Tip Calculator App
Reacreate a tip calculator application in Next Js with Tailwind CSS

Peer Review: George - The math of the the tip amount is correct, but the total is supposed to be (bill + totalTip) / people not the total value of the tip. Outside of that the math works. For the styling I have some recommendations. Remove the focus outline to all the inputs, give all the inputs a transparent border and then on hover it changes to the hover color so that there's no size change on the inputs when hovering, the logo should have a margin top and buttom that is equal, add the hover color for the reset button, for the input's parent div give it an align-items: center so the image is always centered vertically, I hoticed when the input divs resized the image would still be attatched to the top. Outside of those changes it's just down to resizing the elements so that they match the design sizes.
